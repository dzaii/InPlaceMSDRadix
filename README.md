# InPlaceMSDRadix

Had an idea for sorting algorithm, after some research I found out it is "Sort in place Most Significant Digit Radix Sort".
Current implementation works only on unsigned integers. 
* Time complexity is O(k*n) where k is the number of binary digits of the largest number in array.
* Space complexity is O(1).
